# Movies Web Application
A web application that interacts with `movies-api` to display all data retrieved

## Requirements
In order to run the API locally, you'll need the following installed on your machine:

- [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting started

1. Ensure that `movies-api` is running on port `8080`.
2. The application can then be started using the command `mvn spring-boot:run`
3. The application will be running on port `8090`

## Notes
- The application will not run correctly unless the `movies-api` application is up and running
